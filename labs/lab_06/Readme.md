I use MacOs, so it's impossible to check it with .exe, but it works perfectly with this as example. I am really sorry
rostyslav@Apples-MacBook-Pro client % chmod +x client/client
./client/client draw square 100 500  200 200
Message sent successfully: draw square 100 500 200 200
rostyslav@Apples-MacBook-Pro client % chmod +x client/client
./client/client draw circle 50 50 500
Message sent successfully: draw circle 50 50 500
rostyslav@Apples-MacBook-Pro client % chmod +x client/client
./client/client draw line 50 50 100 100
Message sent successfully: draw line 50 50 100 100

(before that - cmake .., make)
